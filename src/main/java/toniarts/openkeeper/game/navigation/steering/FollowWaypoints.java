/**

 * steering does (0x4D3C40). The creature heads for its next waypoint from
 * wherever it is, so one pushed aside is not pulled back onto a line.
 * <br>
 * A waypoint is passed within 1.2 of the creature's radii, the walk ends
 * within half a radius of the last one. Workers pass a waypoint within half a
 * tile and stop within a tenth of a tile.
 * <br>
 * DK II works the steering out once a game tick, as a change of the velocity
 * of a tick, and adds it with the weight 0.35 (0x4D56E0, 0x4D4760). The
 * acceleration here spreads that change over the tick. DK II also slows down
 * for a crowd round the waypoint and turns to face it before walking; neither
 * is done here.
