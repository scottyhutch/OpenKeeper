/**
 * Walks a creature from waypoint to waypoint the way DK II's follow_path
 * steering does (0x4D3C40). The creature heads for its next waypoint from
 * wherever it is, so one pushed aside is not pulled back onto a line.
 * <br>
 * A waypoint is passed within 1.2 of the creature's radii, the walk ends
 * within half a radius of the last one. Workers pass a waypoint within half a
 * tile and stop within a tenth of a tile.
 * <br>
 * DK II works the steering out once a game tick, as a change of the velocity
 * of a tick, and adds it with the weight 0.35 (0x4D56E0, 0x4D4760). The
 * acceleration here spreads that change over the tick.
 * <br>
 * A creature slows down for a crowd round its next waypoint: the share of the
 * way it wants to cover in a tick drops by the sum of the radii of the
 * creatures there, up to 1 (0x4D15E0). Most creatures nearly stop for a crowd
 * of 1, workers don't. A chase does it at the last waypoint too, where a walk
 * otherwise arrives (DK II's path flag 2, 0x471D10). DK II also turns a
 * creature to face its waypoint before walking, that is not done here.
 * <br>
 * A waypoint inside an obstacle, which holds the creature off it, is passed
 * within 0.8 tiles (0x4D2850). Each tick the creature notes whether it got no
 * nearer the end of its walk. Held up in 5 of the last 15 ticks, it walks
 * through the obstacles until that is down to 2 (0x4D3C40, 0x4D4760).
